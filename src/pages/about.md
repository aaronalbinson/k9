      ## About Hydrotherapy


      Hydrotherapy is very beneficial to dogs of all fitness levels. Not only is
      it fun, the excercise is vital for keeping your dog happy and healthy. In
      five minutes swimming in our pool, your dogs will expend the same amount
      of energy as they would on a five mile walk. We also offer rehabilitation
      to dogs with injuries, such as: hip/elbow dysplasia, cruciate ligament
      damage, arthritis and more.


      ## First Swim (Pool Induction)


      Your first visit is an induction. The cost includes a safety induction and
      consultation with our hydrotherapist, for “up to” 30 minutes per dog.
      Generally, inductions will be shorter. This allows us to take our time
      with especially nervous or anxious dogs. We recommend 30 minutes per dog
      as experience has taught us that both dogs and their owners benefit from a
      longer first session. 


      After your first visit you can choose to have assisted or non-assisted
      sessions (see below).


      Please note -  Prices for your first swim are at a reduced rate of £20 per
      30 minute session. After your first visit you can choose to have assisted
      or non-assisted sessions (see below).


      Please note: For your first swim we do ask for payment in advance, (due to
      late cancellations and 'no shows'). This payment can be made over the
      phone. Thanks for your understanding.


      ## Swimming with your dog


      We allow and encourage you to come in and swim with your dog. We have
      changing rooms and you may swim in whatever you feel most comfortable in,
      whether its a swim costume/bikini, shorts & T-shirt or a wet suit! After
      your swim session you will be directed to the drying area - we have
      showers for you and your dogs, as well as dryers for the dogs (we
      recommend you still bring a towel for your dog as some don't like dryers).


      ## Before the swim


      Before coming for your session, please ensure you allow your dog ample
      time to go to the toilet, as accidents in the pool, although very
      infrequent, are charged at £50 - this is because we may have to close the
      pool for a while afterwards. Also, please don't feed your dog within 2
      hours before you come, and for at least 2 hours afterwards.
